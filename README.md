## Project Details

### Slot Machine
- **Description:** A simple slot machine program that simulates a random result based on three reels, with a winning condition if all three symbols match.
- **Technologies Used:** C++, random number generation, loops.
- **How to Run:**
    1. Clone the repository.
    2. Navigate to the project directory.
    3. Compile using your C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ slot_machine.cpp -o slot_machine`).
    4. Run the executable (e.g., `./slot_machine`).

### Magic 8 Ball
- **Description:** A digital version of the Magic 8 Ball toy, where the program provides random answers to yes/no questions.
- **Technologies Used:** C++, random number generation, user input.
- **How to Run:**
    1. Clone the repository.
    2. Navigate to the project directory.
    3. Compile using your C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ magic_8_ball.cpp -o magic_8_ball`).
    4. Run the executable (e.g., `./magic_8_ball`).

### Hello World
- **Description:** A basic "Hello, World!" program to demonstrate simple output and syntax in C++.
- **Technologies Used:** C++ syntax, basic output.
- **How to Run:**
    1. Clone the repository.
    2. Navigate to the project directory.
    3. Compile using your C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world`).
    4. Run the executable (e.g., `./hello_world`).

### Circle Calculator
- **Description:** A program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle based on the user input for radius.
- **Technologies Used:** C++, user input, basic math operations.
- **How to Run:**
    1. Clone the repository.
    2. Navigate to the project directory.
    3. Compile using your C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ circle_calculator.cpp -o circle_calculator`).
    4. Run the executable (e.g., `./circle_calculator`).

### Review
- **Description:** A program that reviews concepts learned so far in the course, allowing the user to input questions and get feedback.
- **Technologies Used:** C++, user input, conditional statements.
- **How to Run:**
    1. Clone the repository.
    2. Navigate to the project directory.
    3. Compile using your C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ review.cpp -o review`).
    4. Run the executable (e.g., `./review`).
